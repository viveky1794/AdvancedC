	1. I created one file of size 5MB name < vfsFile >
		
		$ truncate -s 5M vfsFile

	2. I formated this file with vfat filesystem.

		$ mkfs.vfat -F 12 vfsFile

	3. Take hexdump of this vfsFile

		$ hexdump -C vfsFile > hexdumpOfvfsFile

	4. mount this <vfsFile>. So I create one directory name <fileMountPoint>
	   And mount <vfsFile> with this folder.
		
		$ mkdir fileMountPoint 
		$ sudo mount ./vfsFile fileMountPoint

	5. Now I can check that it is mounted OR not.

		$ df -h
		$ lsblk -f

	6. I create a file under < fileMountPoint > name < newFile1.txt >
	7. I take hexdump again and See the changes again.
	8. I write few words into file. and again check hexdump and see changes again.
	9. I made another folder into it where i open a file newFile.c and Write few words.
	10.
